## Overview

Cuey supports full URLs for webhook endpoints. When creating events or cron jobs, you must provide a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL.

## Full URLs

Full URLs include the complete URL with protocol, domain, and path:

```
https://api.example.com/webhook
```

### URL Requirements

- Must start with `http://` or `https://`
- Must be a valid URL format
- Domain must be resolvable (for webhook delivery)

### Example URLs

```
https://api.example.com/webhook
https://api.example.com/api/v1/webhooks/notify
http://localhost:3000/webhook
https://webhook.site/unique-id
```

## When to Use Different URL Patterns

### Production APIs

Use your production API domain:

```
https://api.production.com/webhook
```

### Staging/Development APIs

Use staging or development domains:

```
https://api.staging.com/webhook
http://localhost:3000/webhook
```

### External Webhooks

For external services or webhook testing tools:

```
https://webhook.site/unique-id
https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

## URL Validation

Cuey validates webhook URLs when creating events or cron jobs. Invalid URLs will be rejected with a validation error.

### Valid URL Examples

- ✅ `https://api.example.com/webhook`
- ✅ `http://localhost:3000/webhook`
- ✅ `https://webhook.site/abc123`

### Invalid URL Examples

- ❌ `api.example.com/webhook` (missing protocol)
- ❌ `example.com/webhook` (missing protocol)
- ❌ `invalid-url` (not a valid URL format)

## Best Practices

### Use HTTPS in Production

Always use HTTPS URLs in production environments:

- ✅ `https://api.example.com/webhook`
- ❌ `http://api.example.com/webhook` (not secure)

### Store URLs in Configuration

Store webhook URLs in environment variables or configuration files rather than hardcoding them:

```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://api.example.com/webhook
```

### Validate URLs Before Creating Events

Validate URLs in your application before sending them to Cuey to catch errors early.
