## Quick Example

Schedule a one-time webhook:

```typescript
import { cuey } from "cuey";

const event = await cuey.schedule({
  webhook_url: "https://api.example.com/webhook",
  scheduled_at: "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  payload: { message: "Happy New Year!" },
});
```

Create a recurring webhook:

```typescript
const cron = await cuey.repeat({
  webhook_url: "https://api.example.com/daily-report",
  cron_expression: "0 9 * * *", // 9 AM daily
  timezone: "America/New_York",
  payload: { report_type: "daily" },
});
```
