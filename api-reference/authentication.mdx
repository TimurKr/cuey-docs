## Getting an API Key

1. Create an account at [cuey.dev/dashboard](https://cuey.dev/dashboard)
2. Go to team settings
3. Generate an API key

<Warning>
Never commit your API key to version control. Use environment variables.
</Warning>

## Using the API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

```bash
curl -X GET https://cuey.dev/api/v1/crons \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here"
```

## Invalid API Key

Invalid or missing API keys return `401 Unauthorized`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Unauthorized. Invalid or missing API key.",
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
  }
}
```

## Team Isolation

API keys are scoped to teams. You can only access resources belonging to your team.
