description: "Delete a cron job"
---

## Overview

Delete a cron job. Deleting a cron job will also delete all events created by that cron job (due to cascade delete).

<RequestExample>

```typescript Delete cron
import { cuey } from "cuey";

await cuey.crons.delete("cron-id");
```

</RequestExample>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The UUID of the cron job to delete.
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns `void` on success. No response body is returned.

<ResponseExample>

```typescript Success
// Method returns void, no response body
```

</ResponseExample>

## Errors

<Warning>
Deleting a cron job will also delete all events created by that cron job (due to cascade delete).
</Warning>

- `NotFoundError`: If the cron job doesn't exist
- `UnauthorizedError`: If API key is invalid or missing

## Examples

### Delete Cron with Confirmation

```typescript
import { cuey } from "cuey";

const cron = await cuey.crons.get("cron-id");

// List events created by this cron
const { data: events } = await cuey.events.list({
  cron_id: cron.id,
});

console.log(`This cron has ${events.length} events that will be deleted`);

// Delete the cron (and all its events)
await cuey.crons.delete(cron.id);
console.log("Cron deleted successfully");
```

### Safe Delete with Error Handling

```typescript
import { cuey } from "cuey";
import { NotFoundError } from "cuey";

try {
  await cuey.crons.delete("cron-id");
  console.log("Cron deleted successfully");
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof NotFoundError) {
    console.error("Cron not found");
  } else {
    console.error("Error deleting cron:", error);
  }
}
```
